# About Me
As a data professional, I have a strong passion for developing, improving, and automating reporting processes. My strong communication skills allow me to take business requirements from stakeholders and executives and translate them into user friendly reports and dashboards. These reports and dashboards that I have created throughout my career delivered valuable insights to key decision makers that have resulted in reduced labor, improved data accuracy, and the ability to make more informed decisions about the business. I also have experience with ETL, designing databases, and creating data models that improve the reporting process for other analysts and IT people.  I have strong technical knowledge of SQL Server, Power BI, Power BI Service, Excel, Power Query, Power Pivot, Data Modeling, SSRS, Database Design, Dynamics Great Plains ERP, and VBA.
